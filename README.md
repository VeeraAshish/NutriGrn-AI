Considering the current daily life scenarios and health issues people are facing, due to
imbalance of calories consumption. People are facing Fatigue, Nutrient deficiencies,
gastrointestinal abnormalities, such as constipation and our body slows down our
metabolism in an effort to conserve energy due to less intake of calories. Alongside,
people are facing Obesity due to high intake of calories per day. On an average human
need an adequate number of calories in a daily life to get rid off these problems and to
maintain healthy life. The motive of this project is to find the efficient solution which
counts the number of calories present in fruits and vegetables. This project proposes a
solution for recognizing and identifying the number of calories present in fruits and
vegetables. This study presents a deep-learning system for multiclass fruit and
vegetable categorization based on an YOLOv4 model that first recognizes the object
type in an image before classifying into one of two categories fresh or rotten. Studies
have been conducted on using deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks
(CNN) to identify the freshness of fruits and vegetables. The images of the fruits and
vegetables gather from the Kaggle, Then image of the item has been detected by using
YOLOV4 and trained the dataset by using CNN Architecture. Finally, user can insert
the new item to know the calories of the item. The proposed system involves
development of an optimized YOLOV4 model creating an image dataset of fruits and
vegetables, data argumentation and performance validation. With the help of this
proposed system humans can get to know the number of calories they are taking in, and
the major purpose of this ideology is to see a future world as a healthy ecosystem.
